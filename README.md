# Path Finding Algorithms :runner:
Pathfinding algorithms implemented in Unity.

This project implments Dijkstra, AStar, BreadthFirstSearch and GreedyBestFirst on a tiled grid. Set the start position, goal and create walls to visualise the step-by-step process of the algorithm. You can also change the iteration speed as well as color pallet.
